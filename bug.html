<p>This is a common error in HTML.  The problem is that I'm trying to use a JavaScript variable inside an HTML attribute directly, which is not allowed. JavaScript code runs in a different context than HTML rendering.</p> <p>Here's a code snippet demonstrating the error:</p> <code> <div id="myDiv" onclick="alert(myVar)"></div> <script> let myVar = "Hello"; </script> </code> <p>The above code will result in a runtime error because <code>myVar</code> is not accessible from within the HTML <code>onclick</code> attribute at the time the HTML is parsed.</p>
